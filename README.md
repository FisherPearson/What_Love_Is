# What_Love_Is
 This project expects to show how to deal with categorical/ordinal data by using statistical techniques ranging from Statistical Inference to Machine Learning. 

## Dataset
The survey was designed and provided by Vera, a 3rd grade Pychology student at UNAM. On the one hand, She was still gaining some experience by the time she made this survey, as a result the sample
design is merely based on what she thought was best to do. As a consequence, the data is unbalanced and is likely to cause misleading conclusions. On the other hand, this project
wouldn't be possible without her help. Thanks, Vera! 

Most of the data is comprised of text. As per numerical atributes: 5 standard likert scale and 1 numerical (age).

## Topics

We cover:

- Statistical Inference:
  + Two proportion Z test
  + Kruskal-Wallis test
  + Jarque-Bera's test
  + Levene's test
  + Time Series (Descriptive analysis)
  + Contingency tables
 
- Machine Learning
  + Random Forest
  + Naive Bayes Classifier
  + Logistic Regression
  + Ordinal Regression (Coming soon...)


__TEXT ANALISIS IS COMING SOON...__
